# Footnote

A note is a string of text placed at the bottom of a page in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text. The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or citations of a reference work in support of the text.

Footnotes are notes at the foot of the page while endnotes are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work. Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In English, a footnote or endnote _\(1\)_ is normally flagged by a superscripted number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: , which can also be superscripted.

Typographical devices such as the asterisk \(_\) or dagger \(†\) may also be used to point to notes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is_ , †, ‡, §, ‖, ¶. In documents like timetables, many different symbols, letters and numbers may refer the reader to particular notes.

In CJK languages, written with Chinese characters, the symbol ※ \(called reference mark; Japanese: komejirushi; Korean: chamgopyo\) is used for notes and highlighting, analogously to the asterisk in English.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA \(Modern Language Association\) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.

The US Government Printing Office Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.

Associate Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court of the United States is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text \(which is permitted in American legal citation\).

HTML, the predominant markup language for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the working group has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, MediaWiki, for example, has had to introduce its own  tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the Nelson HTML preprocessor.
